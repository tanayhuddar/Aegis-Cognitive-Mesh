System boxes (draw these as rectangles in any diagram tool later):

UI (web dashboard)

Hub API (decision orchestrator)

Node (proposal generator) — start with 1

Storage (ADLS Gen2) — synthetic data files

Digital Twin (ADT) — 5 warehouses, up to 12 routes

Key Vault — secrets

Attestation (MAA) — proves secure environment

Arrows (who talks to whom):

UI → Hub API: “show proposals, approve plan”

Node → Hub API: “submit plan”

Hub API → Digital Twin: “simulate what-if”

Hub API → Key Vault: “request secret if attested”

Node → Attestation: “get attestation token”

Hub API → Storage: “read inputs / write logs”

Trust notes (keep this text as labels in your diagram):

Prove-then-execute: Attestation token + policy-hash must match before key is released.

Audit: Each decision creates a hash-chained record with token digest, policy hash, Z3 verdict, sim deltas.

Cost notes (stickers on diagram):

Keep ADT small and calls minimal.

Use Container Apps or tiny AKS only during demo windows.

Key Vault standard (no Managed HSM).
